Firewalls
----------
If your build machines are hiding behind a firewall, you should add a rule to allow incoming traffic on port 33848.

In Linux you can do this with by issuing the following commands

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 33848 -j ACCEPT
sudo service iptables save
reboot

Screen savers / Screen blanking
------------------------------------
You should disable any screen blanking, power save options.

On a Raspberry, running LXDE, you can do this by issuing the following commands:

xset s off
xset -dpms
